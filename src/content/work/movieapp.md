### Tech & Experience

I made this using React.js with hooks for managing and transferring data through components. Regarding style, I used a mixture of react styled components, inline css and classic css. Data was pulled from third party open source database.

It was excellent practising my skills in the most popular front end framework. Working with data sets this big gave me a new perspective about structuring react components hierarchy as well as managing and transferring data with hooks.
