### Tech & Experience

For making of this website i used vanilla js and vanilla css. Application of various fonts, including font awesome for icons, modern css such as animations, transitions, flex box, grid and many other things.

While making this project I learned many things about responsive design. Using Vanilla JS and CSS with no reliance on libraries made a priceless experience.
