### Description

This backend project is built using NestJS, a popular Node.js framework known for its modular architecture and efficiency. It serves as the foundation for a Cameo-like clone, providing the necessary APIs and services for users to interact with the platform.

### Tech & Experience

This backend project was built using NestJS, a popular Node.js framework known for its modular architecture and efficiency. NestJS provided a solid foundation for the project, allowing me to organize the code into well-defined modules and components. For authentication, I integrated Firebase, a reliable and secure authentication solution. PostgreSQL was chosen as the primary database, offering a robust and scalable option for storing user data, video requests, and other relevant information. To simplify database interactions and reduce boilerplate code, I employed TypeORM, a powerful object-relational mapper.

Through this project, I gained a deeper understanding of backend development principles and practices. I became proficient in using NestJS to build modular and scalable Node.js applications. This project has been invaluable in expanding my knowledge of modern backend development technologies and preparing me for building complex and scalable applications.
