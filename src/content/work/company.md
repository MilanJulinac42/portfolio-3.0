### Tech & Experience

This frontend project was built using Next.js, a popular React framework for building server-rendered or statically generated websites. Next.js provided a robust foundation for the project, streamlining development and optimization. I leveraged React's component-based architecture and hooks to manage state and data flow effectively. Additionally, I employed styled components for creating reusable and themeable styles, ensuring a visually appealing and maintainable design.

Through this project, I gained a deeper understanding of Next.js's features, including server-side rendering, static site generation, and routing. I also honed my React development skills, focusing on component composition, state management, and data flow. This project has been invaluable in expanding my knowledge of modern frontend development practices and preparing me for building scalable and efficient web applications.
